# LAU VLA

## Features
The VLA tool aligns seamlessly with LAU's DoS vision by providing comprehensive support to empower every student to unleash their maximum potential. This tool encompasses the following key features:

1. Study Time Optimization:
This feature informs students about their study hours for each course within the Learning Management System (LMS). It assesses whether students are meeting the recommended study hours set by instructors for their respective courses and sections.
2. Task Management and Tracking:
The VLA tool supports students in managing their tasks by monitoring task completion progress. It ensures that pending tasks are followed up on, promoting timely completion and reducing instances of missed assignments.
3. Content Query Mechanism:
A robust querying mechanism is offered to students, enabling them to search for course-specific materials and relevant content on the internet. This aids in enhancing their understanding of the course material.
4. Exam Support:
The VLA tool assists students during examinations by presenting pertinent information. This equips students with essential study materials and helps them allocate appropriate time for exam preparation.
5. Comprehensive Note Taking:
Students can efficiently create and manage a repository of notes. These notes are derived from instructor-uploaded materials and can be conveniently accessed as a consolidated file or as a collection per course. Furthermore, students can directly share these notes with instructors.
The VLA tool is a holistic solution designed to enhance the learning experience, foster academic success, and facilitate effective communication between students and instructors.
